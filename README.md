# What is this?

Have you ever thought: "Man, I wonder if there are any numbers that only contain 69 and 420, which are divisible by both 69 and 420"?

If the answer is no, this program is for you.

# How does it work?

A **nice** number is a number that only contains 69 and 420, while also being divisible by both. One such number is `420696969420420420`.

By using the magic of BigIntegers and permutations, this program computes and prints **nice** numbers until it stops.

# When does the program stop?

The program will stop when random people will stop asking me to fix their broken printers just because I'm a programmer.

That is, never.

# Why?

Why not?

# License?

I don't know who would want this, but sure: **you can do whatever the @#$% you want with this program**.

The code is an ugly mess anyway. Just make sure to change the package name.

# Anything else?

Thanks to [Zabo](https://github.com/Andreizabo), the madlad who came up with this idea.
